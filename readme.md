# [The Interpreter Book](https://interpreterbook.com)

This repo is for my progress thru the interpreter book, which is a guide thru building your own interpreter for a simple c/js-like programming language called monkey.

I'll be writing it in GO, since I've been wanting to learn go for a while. Thouhg I might also rewrite it in typescript once I'm thru the whole book.

> The `package.json` is for easily running `go run go/main.go` from any location in the repo (via `pnpm go`).
